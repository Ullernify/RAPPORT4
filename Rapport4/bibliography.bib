              for students to develop, yet many students struggle to identify

              Here we describe and evaluate a scaffolded approach for teaching
              undergraduate students to read empirical articles called the
              QALMRI method. The QALMRI is a generalizable instructional tool
              for teaching students to identify the key conceptual information
              necessary for the comprehension and critical evaluation of
              empirical articles. We had students in a first-year introductory
              course and students ina third-year research methods course read
              empirical articles and complete QALMRI outlines throughout the
              semester. We found that students very quickly learned to use the
              QALMRI outline in both upper and lower course levels, with
              performance corresponding to traditional written
              summaries.However, we also found that students consistently
              performed poorly on some items, prompting an update and revision
              to the QALMRI method to address these limitations.",

               investigated the effect of block training periodization on
               maximal oxygen consumption (VO2max) and parameters of exercise
               performance in elite junior alpine skiers. Six female and 15

               13) or control training groups (CT, N = 8). IT performed 15
               high-intensity aerobic interval (HIT) sessions in 11 days.
               Sessions were 4 x 4 min at 90-95\% of maximal heart rate
               separated by 3-min recovery periods. CT continued their
               conventionally mixed training, containing endurance and strength
               sessions. Before and 7 days after training, subjects performed a
               ramp incremental test followed by a high-intensity
               time-to-exhaustion (tlim) test both on a cycle ergometer, a 90-s
               high-box jump test as well as countermovement (CMJ) and squat
               jumps (SJ) on a force plate. IT significantly improved relative
               VO2max by 6.0\% (P < 0.01; male +7.5\%, female +2.1\%), relative
               peak power output by 5.5\% (P < 0.01) and power output at

  abstract  = "CONTEXT: The purpose of study, experimental, or research design
               in scientific manuscripts has changed significantly over the
               years. It has evolved from an explanation of the design of the
               experiment (ie, data gathering or acquisition) to an explanation
               of the statistical analysis. This practice makes ``Methods''
               sections hard to read and understand. OBJECTIVE: To clarify the
               difference between study design and statistical analysis, to
               show the advantages of a properly written study design on
               article comprehension, and to encourage authors to correctly
               describe study designs. DESCRIPTION: The role of study design is
               explored from the introduction of the concept by Fisher through
               modern-day scientists and the AMA Manual of Style. At one time,
               when experiments were simpler, the study design and statistical
               design were identical or very similar. With the complex research
               that is common today, which often includes manipulating
               variables to create new variables and the multiple (and
               different) analyses of a single data set, data collection is
               very different than statistical design. Thus, both a study
               design and a statistical design are necessary. ADVANTAGES:
               Scientific manuscripts will be much easier to read and
               comprehend. A proper experimental design serves as a road map to
               the study methods, helping readers to understand more clearly
               how the data were obtained and, therefore, assisting them in
               properly analyzing the results.",

               and statistical analysis of sport performance research, rather
               than to supply an authoritative 'cookbook' of methods. In
               general, we try to communicate some possible solutions to the
               conundrum of how to maintain both internal and external
               validity, as well as optimize statistical power, in applied
               sport performance research. We start by arguing that some sport
               performance research has been overly concerned with
               physiological predictors of performance, at the expense of not
               providing a valid and reliable description of the exact nature
               of the task in question. We show how the influence of certain
               factors on competitive performances can be described using
               linear or logistic regression. We discuss the choice of analysis
               for factorial repeated-measures designs, which is complicated by
               the assumption of 'sphericity' in a univariate general linear
               model, and the relatively low statistical power of the
               multivariate approach when used with small samples. We consider
               a little-used and simpler technique known as 'analysis of
               summary statistics'. In multi-group pre- and post-test designs,
               a useful technique can be to pair-match individuals on their
               performance scores in a counterbalanced fashion before the
               intervention or control has been introduced. Finally, we outline
               how confidence intervals can help in making statements about the
               probability of the population difference in performance
               exceeding the value designated as being worthwhile or not.",

               individuals. Better reliability implies better precision of
               single measurements and better tracking of changes in
               measurements in research or practical settings. The main
               measures of reliability are within-subject random variation,
               systematic change in the mean, and retest correlation. A simple,
               adaptable form of within-subject variation is the typical
               (standard) error of measurement: the standard deviation of an
               individual's repeated measurements. For many measurements in
               sports medicine and science, the typical error is best expressed
               as a coefficient of variation (percentage of the mean). A
               biased, more limited form of within-subject variation is the
               limits of agreement: the 95\% likely range of change of an
               individual's measurements between 2 trials. Systematic changes
               in the mean of a measure between consecutive trials represent
               such effects as learning, motivation or fatigue; these changes
               need to be eliminated from estimates of within-subject
               variation. Retest correlation is difficult to interpret, mainly
               because its value is sensitive to the heterogeneity of the
               sample of participants. Uses of reliability include
               decision-making when monitoring individuals, comparison of tests
               or equipment, estimation of sample size in experiments and
               estimation of the magnitude of individual differences in the
               response to a treatment. Reasonable precision for estimates of
               reliability requires approximately 50 study participants and at
               least 3 trials. Studies aimed at assessing variation in
               reliability between tests or equipment require complex designs
               and analyses that researchers seldom perform correctly. A wider
               understanding of reliability and adoption of the typical error
               as the standard measure of reliability would improve the
               assessment of tests and equipment in our disciplines.",

  abstract  = "Endurance exercise training studies frequently show modest
               changes in VO2max with training and very limited responses in
               some subjects. By contrast, studies using interval training (IT)
               or combined IT and continuous training (CT) have reported mean
               increases in VO2max of up to ~1.0 L · min(-1). This raises
               questions about the role of exercise intensity and the
               trainability of VO2max. To address this topic we analyzed IT and
               IT/CT studies published in English from 1965-2012. Inclusion
               criteria were: 1)$\geq$ 3 healthy sedentary/recreationally
               active humans <45 yrs old, 2) training duration 6-13 weeks, 3)
               $\geq$ 3 days/week, 4) $\geq$ 10 minutes of high intensity work,
               5) $\geq$ 1:1 work/rest ratio, and 6) results reported as mean
               $\pm$ SD or SE, ranges of change, or individual data. Due to
               heterogeneity (I(2) value of 70), statistical synthesis of the
               data used a random effects model. The summary statistic of
               interest was the change in VO2max. A total of 334 subjects (120
               women) from 37 studies were identified. Participants were
               grouped into 40 distinct training groups, so the unit of
               analysis was 40 rather than 37. An increase in VO2max of 0.51 L
               · min(-1) (95\% CI: 0.43 to 0.60 L · min(-1)) was observed. A
               subset of 9 studies, with 72 subjects, that featured longer
               intervals showed even larger (~0.8-0.9 L · min(-1)) changes in
               VO2max with evidence of a marked response in all subjects. These
               results suggest that ideas about trainability and VO2max should
               be further evaluated with standardized IT or IT/CT training
               programs.",
